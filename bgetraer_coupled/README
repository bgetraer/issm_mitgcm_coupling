This directory contains code to run a coupled MITgcm/ISSM model of a Pine Island like ice shelf.
Code has been adapted from https://github.com/MITgcm-contrib/issm_mitgcm_coupling.git

The runme has been adapted to include the operations previously performed by external files such 
as input/rdmds_init.m, input/gendata.m, and ExpPar/SquareShelf.par. Additionally, the runme has 
been adapted to control the gridding parameters in code/SIZE.h, input/data. These changes allow 
for choiced in domain resolution and size to be implemented consistently from a single point.

Additionally, several changes have been made in how the model domain and boundary conditions are 
implemented, with the aim of more consistently reproducing the model described by Nakayama 2021 
and Jordan 2017.
