This directory contains code to run a coupled ice-ocean model on Pleiades.

There are four phases to the coupled model:
ON TOTTEN:
	1) compile-time setup for MITgcm
		define domain
		create new code directory
ON PLEIADES:
		generate executable
		save executable
	2) initialize ISSM model and run to steady state
		mesh and parameterize
		run to steady state
		save model
	3) run-time setup for MITgcm 
ON PLEIADES:
	4) queue coupled model run on PFE using MCC
